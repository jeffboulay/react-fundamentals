project 
create a simple cms for coffee shop/tinder app
a user should be able to view a list of coffee shops that they have added 
this list should have basic crud functionality 


coffeeshop schema
name
    image
    description
    likes (swipes right)
    Dislikes (swipes left)

like/dislike should be a list of users that liked or disliked 
a user should only be able to do one or the other
check to make sure the user has not already chosen one or the other. if they have only allow them to select the other. 

uploading an image will be difficult so we might want to keep that till we have most of the functionality for the site. 

we should look at the google places API and see what format it provides for the shops and mimic that.
